#Project Architecture:
1) Class Structure:
The project follows an object-oriented approach with well-defined classes for different functionalities such as calendar management, task handling, and reminder setting.
Each class encapsulates related data and methods, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.

2) Date Handling:
The Calendar class handles date-related operations such as calculating day numbers, determining the number of days in a month, and checking for leap years.
It utilizes algorithms to perform date calculations efficiently and accurately.

3) Task Management:
The addTask(), displayTasks(), editTask(), and removeTask() methods facilitate task management functionalities, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks from the calendar.
Task data is stored in a file (tasks.txt) using file handling operations.

4) User Interaction:
User interaction is managed through the main() function, which presents a menu-driven interface for users to navigate and utilize different features of the digital calendar.
Input/output operations handle

5) Reminder System:
The setReminder() method checks for upcoming tasks based on the current date and alerts users with reminders.
It utilizes file handling to retrieve task data from the storage file and compares dates to identify tasks due on the current day.

6) Error Handling:
Error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the code to ensure robustness and reliability.
File operations, user inputs, and date calculations are validated to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure smooth execution of the application.

7) Scalability:
The project architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration of additional features and functionalities in future iterations.
Modularity and encapsulation enable seamless extension and modification of the codebase to accommodate evolving user requirements and technological advancements.

Overall, the project architecture prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and extensibility, providing a solid foundation for the development of a user-friendly and feature-rich digital calendar application.


#Conclusion -
In conclusion, our digital calendar project offers a robust and user-friendly solution for efficient schedule management. Leveraging C++ and standard libraries, the application provides essential features such as calendar display, task management, reminder setting, and date checking. With a structured architecture, error handling mechanisms, and scalability in mind, the project delivers a reliable tool for users to organize their tasks and appointments effectively.
